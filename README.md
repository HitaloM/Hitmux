# Hitmux

A script to make my Termux experience more enjoyable.

## Features

- A minimal ZSh setup, consisting of:
    - Ultra-flexible and fast [plugin manager](https://github.com/zdharma/zinit), compatible with most of the plugins in the wild.
    - A really fast and reliable [syntax-highlighter](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting).
    - Reliable [shell completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions) and [automatic suggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions).
    - The fast, powerful, and highly customizable [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) theme.

## Requirements

 - A device running Android 5.0 or above. (Recommended to have Android 7.0+ coz of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/termux/comments/dnzdbs/end_of_android56_support_on_20200101/))
 - Termux app, __duh__. (Install from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/))


## Installation

Installing this is as easy as running the command below in Termux.

```shell
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HitaloSama/Hitmux/master/doc/install.sh)"
```
